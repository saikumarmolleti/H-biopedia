        <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
        <p>
          <span>Monhandas Karamchand Gandhi</span> was born in the small town of
          Porbandar, on the west coast of India, on October 2 1869.
          <span>He belonged by birth to the Vaishya,</span> or trading caste.
          His father died when he was 15 years old, and apart from that time,
          his mother became the greatest influence in his life. Her spiritual
          teacher was a Jain devotee. Among the Jains in India the central
          doctrine is the <span>"sanctity of all life,"</span> or
          <span>Ahimsa,</span> which is often translated as
          <span>"non-violence."</span> This teaching remained paramount with
          Gandhi.

          In 1896 he went to the Transvaal to help a client in a legal suit.
          That visit changed the whole course of his life. Seeing the social and
          political disabilities of his fellow-countrymen in South Africa,
          <span
            >he decided to stay and help them and soon he had become their
            political leader and adviser.</span
          >
          Meanwhile a religious conflict was taking place in within him. He read
          Tolstoy and corresponded with him: the result was an experiment in the
          simple communal life conducted by a small band of enthusiasts whom he
          had gathered together. He became an ascetic of the most rigorous type,
          setting great store by fasting and every form of self-denial. To the
          end of his life he remained a devout Hindu, but declared if ever
          "untouchability" were made part of Hinduism he would cease to be a
          Hindu. Perhaps the greatest religious effort of his life was to break
          down "untouchability."
